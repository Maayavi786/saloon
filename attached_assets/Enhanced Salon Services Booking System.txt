Customer App: User-friendly interface for customers to sign up/log in, discover services, book appointments, make payments, manage notifications, view loyalty rewards, provide feedback, and access support.
Salon Owner Panel: Web and/or mobile interface for salon owners to manage their profiles, salon details, listings, bookings, staff, services, promotions, and access support.

Backend:
Technology Stack:
Frontend:
Web: React.js. Justification: React's component-based architecture facilitates building interactive UIs, its large community provides ample support and libraries, and its performance is well-suited for a dynamic application.
Mobile: React Native. Justification: Leveraging React Native allows for cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android) from a single codebase, reducing development time and cost.
Backend:
Node.js with Express.js. Justification: Node.js is highly scalable and efficient for real-time applications, and Express.js provides a robust framework for building APIs. The JavaScript ecosystem allows for full-stack development with a single language, which can streamline development.
Database:
PostgreSQL. Justification: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, data integrity, and support for complex queries. It's well-suited for handling structured data and provides features like JSON support for flexibility.
Components:
Authentication & Authorization: Secure login with OAuth integration (Google, Apple, Facebook) and two-factor authentication. Saudi ID verification for added security.
Appointment Management: Handles booking, cancellation, modification, and real-time availability updates for appointments.
Payment Gateway Integration:
The system will integrate with multiple payment gateways to provide users with flexibility and cater to local preferences.
Mada: Direct integration with Mada will be a priority to support the widely used local debit card system in Saudi Arabia. This will likely involve using a Saudi-based payment service provider (PSP) that facilitates Mada transactions.
PayPal and Apple Pay: These will be integrated using their respective official SDKs or APIs to provide users with familiar and secure payment options.
Security: All payment transactions will be processed through secure, PCI DSS compliant payment gateways. Tokenization will be used to protect sensitive cardholder data.
